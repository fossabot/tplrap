# TP-Link Router Administration Panel
This program was created to simplify the login to the admin panel on TP-Link routers. This program requires a connection to the router via Wi-Fi. This program uses CefSharp, so the program loads the page http://tplinkwifi.net/ (works only on TP-Link routers). Ie, this program is a shortcut to access the administration panel.
